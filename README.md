Python application that implements a computer vision system for volume and mouse control using real-time hand gestures recognition. It leverages OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, MediaPipe for hand detection and gesture recognition, and PyAutoGUI to perform corresponding actions on the computer, such as moving the cursor, left-clicking, right-clicking, double-clicking, volume up/down.
